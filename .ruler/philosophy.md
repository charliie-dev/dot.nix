## Development Philosophy

- **Pragmatism over theory**: Solve real problems, not imaginary threats
- **Simplicity**: If implementation needs more than 3 levels of indentation, redesign it
- **Backward compatibility**: Never break existing functionality; any change that causes existing programs to fail is a bug
- **Good taste**: Eliminate edge cases through better design rather than adding conditional checks
